# Week 5

## Weekly Goals
1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language


<h1 align="center">1 - Build a Simple Front-End Web App with Javascript </h1>

#### Notes
- We worked in an entirely new language, Javascript. 
- We began by translating simple ruby programs we had made previously into javascript, to get to grips with the basics of the language.
- We incorporated Jasmine to test drive our javascript programs, and JQuery to enhance our web functionalisation.

#### How I Achieved This Goal 
- Throughout the week, I created a thermostat app. This introduced many brand new concepts of Javascript, Ajax requests, web page functionality, interactive web pages and the use of JQuery. 
- This was very useful in learning the linking of back-end logic and front-end web developement, and was the first time I had used CSS to enhance my program. 
- We also incorporated an API to allow global searching to determine the weather at any city in the world. 
- Here is a picture of the web app: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61867184/89882976-7a945780-dbbf-11ea-950c-0582ea679585.png)
