# Week 2

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn how to use Capybara and Sinatra to build and locally host a simple web app.


<h1 align="center">1 - Building a Simple Web App </h1>

#### Notes
- We learned about the internet's client/server response structure, and implemented this in designing a couple of simple web-based games.
- Learned how to use Sinatra as a framework and capybara as a user-imitating testing framework. 

#### How I Achieved This Goal 
- Completed a simple turn-based battle game, to be locally hosted. This was invaluable in teaching me about get/post requests, controller redirection and the controller/model/view layering system. The battle repo can be found [here](https://github.com/harrylb14/Battle). This also implements srand() in order to mock random methods, a very useful tool. This game has both single player and multiplayer functionality.
- Completed a web-based rock paper scissors game. This further developed skills in ruby web-app developement as well as practising the use of HTML. A similar concept to the battle game, starting from scratch was useful in consolidating learning from making the battle game. This again has both single and multiplayer functionality and implements random mocking. It can be found [here](https://github.com/harrylb14/rps-challenge).
